# Project Euler Solutions. 

The following repository contains all of my solutions to the problems defined on Project Euler. For fun, I have also tried to write a solution in the style of code-golf for some fun. As given in `Program.cs`: 

```
        // The following console can be used to gain each of the solutions to the problems on project euler that
        // I have solved. There is also a version that has been code-golfed, which is just for fun. These algorithms 
        // may not be the most efficient method of solving these problems but this is the best way I can come up with. 
        // 
        // You may wish to use these programs to validate your own answers. As all solutions given within the repo have 
        // given valid answers on the Project Euler website. Please for your own sake, use this code to just copy and paste
        // all of the correct answers. You are missing out on the enjoyment of programming. 
        // 
        // Each solution is given as a static class so simply change the static class to the problem number that you want and 
        // run this solution. The answer should be given in the console. The problem has also been defined in the class definition 
        // in case you do not want to look at the website yourself. 
```

The code and solutions contained in this repository are free-to-use in any way.
